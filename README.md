# Password Generator

This exercise was to demonstrate the JavaScript we've learned in the second week.
I ran out of time finishing the drill as I needed to define the possible characters array post user input and then generate random characters equal to the password length specified by the user.  Then I needed to display the new password inthe "undefined" field.
